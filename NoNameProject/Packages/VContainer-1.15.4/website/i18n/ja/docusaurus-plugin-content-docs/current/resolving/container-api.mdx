title: Container API
---

You can also access the DI container directly via `IObjectResolver`. VContainer automatically registers `IObjectResolver` and injects it wherever it's needed, so you can obtain it just as you would for any other dependency.

For example:

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    public ClassA(IObjectResolver container)
    {
        // Get (or create) whatever is registered as ServiceA.
        // This might be a subclass if you registered the
        // subclass as a ServiceA.
        var serviceA = container.Resolve<ServiceA>();

        // Inject all relevant dependencies into foo. Injecting
        // an object twice will overwrite any property or
        // field (or call the method) which is marked with [Inject].
        container.Inject(foo);

        // Inject dependencies into the MonoBehaviours of this
        // GameObject and its descendents, regardless of whether
        // the targeted GameObjects and MonoBehaviours are enabled.
        container.InjectGameObject(gameObject);

        // Instantiate a GameObject from a prefab and inject
        // its MonoBehaviours (and those of its descendents) with
        // dependencies. If you're creating GameObjects through
        // other means (e.g. procedurally or from Addressables)
        // then consider using InjectGameObject.
        var object1 = container.Instantiate(prefab);

        // There are also overloads that mimic Object.Instantiate.
        var object2 = container.Instantiate(prefab, parent);
        var object3 = container.Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation, parent);
    }
}
```

If you regularly use `IObjectResolver.Inject` in a certain pattern, consider writing an [extension method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) for it. In fact, almost every `IObjectResolver` API is an extension method (including in the preceding code sample).

:::tip
You should only need to use `IObjectResolver.Resolve` explicitly if the other supported injection techniques don't fit your needs, or if using a VContainer callback that exposes `IObjectResolver` (e.g. [build callbacks](../registering/register-callbacks) or [certain factory functions](../registering/register-factory#register-func-factory-that-requires-container-dependencies-and-runtime-parameters)). All resolution techniques have similar performance if you use the [IL generator](../optimization/codegen), but directly using `Resolve` requires more code and obscures your intent.
:::

`LifetimeScope` has an `IObjectResolver` reference through its `Container` property. VContainer also registers it automatically, but you won't need it too often after the container is built.

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    public ClassA(LifetimeScope currentScope)
    {
        // You can inject LifetimeScope if you need to, but
        // in this case it would be enough to just inject ServiceA.
        var foo = currentScope.Container.Resolve<ServiceA>();
    }
}
```
