[MessagePipe](https://github.com/Cysharp/MessagePipe) is a messaging library designed for DI that supports both Unity and .NET Core (although VContainer currently only supports Unity).

MessagePipe includes optional VContainer integration. For more information about using them together, see [here](https://github.com/Cysharp/MessagePipe#unity).
